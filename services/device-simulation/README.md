> This folder references the *scripts* required for starting simulation micro-service in docker. The code of this micro-service resides [here](https://github.com/Azure/device-simulation-dotnet). 

How to use the microservice
===========================

## Quickstart - Running the service with Docker

1. Install docker-compose.
2. Create RM local installation (cloud resoures and environment variables) using [pcs-cli](pcs-cli-url). Build the cli as per the instruction given on the github  page and run the following command.
    ```
    pcs -s local
    ```
2. In order to run the service, some environment variables need to be created
at least once. See specific instructions for IDE or command line setup below
for more information. More information on environment variables
[here](#configuration-and-environment-variables).Â 
* `PCS_AAD_APPID` = { Azure service principal id }
* `PCS_AAD_APPSECRET` = { Azure service principal secret }
* `PCS_KEYVAULT_NAME` = { Name of Key Vault resource that stores settings and configuration }

3. Start the Simulation service using docker compose:
   ```
   cd scripts
   cd docker
   docker-compose up
   ```
1. Use an HTTP client such as [Postman][postman-url], to exercise the
   [RESTful API][wiki-createsim-url] to create a simulation.


## Configuration and Environment variables

The service configuration is accessed via ASP.NET Core configuration
adapters, and stored in [appsettings.ini](https://github.com/Azure/device-simulation-dotnet/blob/master/WebService/appsettings.ini).
The INI format allows to store values in a readable format, with comments.

The configuration also supports references to environment variables, e.g. to
import credentials and network details. Environment variables are not
mandatory though, you can for example edit appsettings.ini and write
credentials directly in the file. Just be careful not sharing the changes,
e.g. sending a Pull Request or checking in the changes in git.

The configuration file in the repository references some environment
variables that need to be defined. Depending on the OS and the IDE used,
there are several ways to manage environment variables.

1. When running the service **with Docker** or **from the command line**, the
   application will inherit environment variables values from the system.
