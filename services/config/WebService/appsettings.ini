; Identifies the security token service (STS) that constructs and returns the token.
; In the tokens that Azure AD returns, the issuer is sts.windows.net. The GUID in
; the Issuer claim value is the tenant ID of the Azure AD directory. The tenant ID
; is an immutable and reliable identifier of the directory.
; Used to verify that tokens are issued by Azure AD.
; When using Azure Active Directory, the format of the Issuer is:
; https://sts.windows.net/<tenant Id>/
; example: issuer="https://sts.windows.net/fa01ade2-2365-4dd1-a084-a6ef027090fc/"
